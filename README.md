# Rock Paper Scissors

## Project Overview
This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game. The game is built using JavaScript as part of the Foundations Course of The Odin Project. The objective of this project is to create a basic version of the game that can be played entirely in the console.

## How to Play
1. The player will be prompted to enter their choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer will randomly select its choice.
3. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors
   - Scissors beats Paper
   - Paper beats Rock
4. The result will be displayed in the console.

## Getting Started
To run the game locally:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bharat705/rock-paper-scissors.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rock-paper-scissors
    ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to see the game running in the console. Alternatively, you can run the `script.js` file in your preferred JavaScript environment.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The basic HTML structure for the project.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## Features
- Basic implementation of Rock Paper Scissors that runs in the console.
- Random computer selection to play against the user.
- User-friendly prompts and console output to display results.
- Basic score tracking to allow multiple rounds of play.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the game more interactive.
- Add animations and sound effects to enhance the gaming experience.
